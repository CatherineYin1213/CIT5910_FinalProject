Description:
This project is a text-based implementation of the classic Battleship game. The game involves placing ships on a 10x10 ocean grid and allowing the player to fire shots to sink all the ships. The project includes the following features:
1. Random placement of ships.
2. User input for firing shots.
3. Real-time feedback on hits, misses, and sunk ships.
4. A game-over condition when all ships are sunk.
5. Unit tests for core functionalities.
